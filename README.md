## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 🔹 Option 1: Automated (Linux / Mac)

```bash
cd twitter_clone
chmod +x setup_and_run.sh
./setup_and_run.sh
```

---

### 🔹 Option 2: Manual Setup

#### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install Django scikit-learn nltk pandas numpy Pillow django-crispy-forms crispy-bootstrap5 joblib
```

#### 2. Download NLP Resources

```bash
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('wordnet')"
```

#### 3. Apply Migrations

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

#### 4. Create Admin User

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

#### 5. Train ML Model (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python ml_engine/train_model.py
```

Or with dataset:

```bash
python ml_engine/train_model.py path/to/dataset.csv
```

#### 6. Run Server

## 🤖 Machine Learning Pipeline

### Workflow

1. User submits content
2. `analyze_text()` processes input
3. Preprocessing:

   * Lowercasing
   * URL removal
   * Stopword filtering
   * Lemmatization
4. TF-IDF vectorization
5. Logistic Regression classification:

   * `normal`
   * `hate_speech`
   * `cyberbullying`
6. If harmful:

   * Flag created
   * Admin notified

---

## 📊 Model Improvement

Train with real datasets for higher accuracy:

* Kaggle Hate Speech Dataset
* HatEval Dataset

Expected format:

```
text,label
"This is abusive",hate_speech
```

---

## 🔐 Admin Privileges Setup

```bash
python manage.py shell
```

```python
from accounts.models import User
u = User.objects.get(username='yourusername')
u.is_staff = True
u.save()
```

---

## 🚀 Production Deployment

Recommended stack:

* Gunicorn (WSGI server)
* Nginx (reverse proxy)
* MySQL / PostgreSQL
* WhiteNoise (static file serving)

⚠️ Important:

* Set `DEBUG = False`
* Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
* Secure `SECRET_KEY`
* Use environment variables

---

## 🧭 Design Philosophy

This project is not just a clone—it's a **reimagined social platform**:

* Content ≠ just publishing → it's **risk-evaluated communication**
* Moderation ≠ reactive → it's **predictive and proactive**
* Admin ≠ passive → it's **decision intelligence**

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Real-time WebSocket feeds
* Transformer-based NLP models (BERT)
* Shadow banning & trust scores
* AI-assisted moderation suggestions
* Distributed microservices architecture

## 💡 Final Thought

Twitterly isn’t just a clone.
It’s a **prototype for responsible social networks**—where AI doesn’t replace humans, but amplifies better decisions.
